# The Live Coding Synth for Everyone.

Sonic Pi is a *new kind of musical instrument*. Instead of strumming
strings or whacking things with sticks - you write code - LIVE.

Sonic Pi has been designed with the aim to find a harmonious balance
between three core principles:

* SIMPLE enough for the 10 year old within you
* JOYFUL enough for you to lose yourself through play
* POWERFUL enough for your own expressions

Sonic Pi is a complete open source programming environment originally
designed to explore and *teach programming concepts* within schools
through the process of creating *new sounds*. 

In addition to being an engaging education resource it has evolved into 
an *extremely powerful* and performance-ready *live coding instrument*
suitable for professional artists and DJs.

Whilst Education is a core focus it now sits at the intersection
between three core domains:

* ART        - providing the means to express yourself and ask
               new questions of music and notation
* TECHNOLOGY - exploring questions related to liveness, time and
               concurrency in programming languages
* EDUCATION  - demonstrating that open play rather than rigid structures
               increases motivation and engagement in the classroom

Again, finding a balance working to the best benefits of all these
domains is the objective.
